## Generating MBTA Track Mileage by UZA

In 2022, the US Census Bureau released updated urbanized area boundaries. The `.qmd` in this repo outlines the process of intersecting the [MassGIS Data: Trains](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-trains) dataset over these geographies.

We use the MassGIS dataset because it appears to have more detail on the layout of the actual tracks--it appears to account for single track segments and all of the tracks at terminal stations. The GTFS file is used to more accurately end the Foxboro service, which is represented as the full length of service between Walpole and the Providence Line. Other changes including fixing a small segment of track on the Lowell Line that was observed during the checking process. We also remove Plymouth Station, which is no longer in service.
